# Undertale Save
I'm playing Undertale through Wine with a dedicated Wine prefix, where AppData/UNDERTALE and system_information_* are under version control. I am using branches to create infinite timelines with infinite branching paths.

I have already cleared the True Pacifist ending in my main Wine prefix. I am leaving that save alone; it is basically sacred to me at this point.

If you would like me to try anything, file an issue report and I'll do it! :D The first branch is genocide.
